# Project Overview

This project is a full-stack decentralized web application designed to leverage blockchain technology for secure, transparent, and tamper-proof interactions. The frontend provides an intuitive user interface, while the backend manages API requests and interactions with smart contracts deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contracts, written in Solidity, handle core business logic such as event logging, role-based permissions, and transaction validations, ensuring trustless and automated processes.

# How to Edit the Project

You can edit this project in several ways:

* **Online Web Interface:** Use the projectâ€™s web-based editing platform to modify frontend, backend, and smart contract code. Changes are synced automatically.

* **Local Development:** Clone the repository locally, install Node.js and dependencies, and set up a development environment including blockchain tools. You can compile, test, and deploy Solidity smart contracts using frameworks like Hardhat or Truffle. Run the development server for live preview and interaction with deployed contracts. Push changes back to the repository to sync.

* **GitHub:** Edit files directly in GitHub or submit pull requests for collaborative development.

* **Codespaces:** Use GitHub Codespaces for a ready-to-use cloud IDE with built-in support for both frontend and smart contract development.

# Technologies Used

This project uses the following technologies:

* **Vite:** Fast frontend build and development tool.
* **TypeScript:** Typed JavaScript superset for robust coding.
* **React:** Component-based UI library.
* **shadcn-ui:** UI component library for consistent styling.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling and layout.
* **Node.js & Express:** Backend server handling API logic and blockchain interaction.
* **Solidity:** Programming language for writing Ethereum smart contracts.
* **Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet):** Blockchain platform for deploying and executing smart contracts.
* **Web3.js / Ethers.js:** Libraries to enable frontend and backend interaction with Ethereum smart contracts.
* **MetaMask Integration:** Wallet-based user authentication and transaction signing.
